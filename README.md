# Pokemon Type Prediction Using Knn and Neural Networks
The dataset used in this project contains 800 different pokemons which belong to seven generations. The project focuses on predicting the types of pokemon and whether the pokemon are legendary or not based on machine learning techniques. In particular, we will take advantage of:

1. Knn algorithm
2. Neural  network
There are in total, 18 different types of pokemon that are present in the dataset. The pokemon is said to be legendary if the value is 1 and is not legendary if the value is 0. The features influencing the type of the pokemon are the abilities and the strength of the pokemon against other pokemon. The features that determine if the pokemon is legendary or not is the attack,defense,special attack,special defense,HP, height,weight and experience. 640 data points are used for training and 160 for testing the model. Alright, lets catch 'em all!
